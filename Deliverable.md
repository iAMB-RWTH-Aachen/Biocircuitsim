# **Assignment: Designing a Genetic Circuit for Hierarchical Carbon Utilization in *Pseudomonas putida***

## **Objective**
Your task is to design a genetic circuit that enables *Pseudomonas putida* to preferentially consume glucose before switching to glycerol. This circuit must be based on logical regulation of metabolic pathways, ensuring that the glycerol pathway is only activated once glucose is depleted. Your submission will include both a design proposal and a biological rationale.

## **Deliverables**
You must submit the following:

1. **Genetic Circuit Design (Core Requirement)**  
   - Define the logic gates and Boolean logic required for pathway regulation.
   - Sketch a genetic interaction diagram, showing key components (e.g., promoters, regulators, repressors, activators) and their relationships.
   - Explain your choices for the promoter and regulator, justifying how they achieve the desired glucose-first, glycerol-second consumption profile.

2. **Biological Rationale (Choose ONE of the following):**
   - **Option A: Potential Challenges and Solutions**  
     - Identify at least one key challenge in implementing your genetic circuit (e.g., metabolic burden, leaky expression, unintended cross-regulation).  
     - Propose a possible solution to mitigate this challenge.  
  
   - **Option B: Environmental or Industrial Considerations**  
     - Discuss how your genetic circuit would perform in an industrial setting (e.g., batch vs. continuous fermentation, variations in feedstock composition, metabolic stability).  
     - Explain how your design accounts for these factors.
