# BioCircuitSim
---

Welcome to BioCircuitSim! This repository is part of the seminar 'synthetic microbiology' for the Biology and Biotechnology
study at the RWTH Aachen University. The aim of this practical class is twofold: 1.) It will teach you how to access and use published
code, data and software using git, and 2.) it will give a basic introduction into logical models for the design of genetic circuits.

## 1. Using git to access published work

## 2. Understand and use boolean logic in genetic circuit design
Now you are ready for take-off! You can open and run the notebook using the following commands:

### Installing all the dependencies
```commandline
pip install requirements.txt
```

### Launching the jupyter notebook
This command will open the jupyter notebook landing page in your browser. Please navigate to the `BioCircuitSim.ipynb` notebook.
```commandline
jupyter notebook
```
